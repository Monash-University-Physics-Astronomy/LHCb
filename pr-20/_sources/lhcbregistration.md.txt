# Registration in the LHCb collaboration
Registration in the LHCb collaboration enables you to
- Read internal web pages of the collaboration
- Use shared computing resources
- Obtain a grid certificate to use the bookkeeping of data and simulation

The registration is a requirement for PhD students and staff and can be convenient for honours and project students.

## External participant
This is the registration that you will initially get. As long as you are not going physically to CERN for study or work, this is the only thing you need. If you do not already have an Orcid ID, please go ahead and [obtain one](https://orcid.org/register).

The registration is initiated by that either Ulrik or Tom fill in the [EDH document](https://edh.cern.ch/Document/Personnel/PreRegistrationForm) and pick `Extrernal` as the status. Let them know your Orcid ID. You will then receive an email that via a link ask you to upload a scan of your passport.

After approval you will receive an email from the LHCb secretariat titled `Registration request approved`. Follow the instructions in that email to the letter apart from the `Pit access` part that you can ignore.

Be prepared that the whole process might take about a week to complete, including the various approvals and the IT traning course that you have to complete.

## CERN User
Your registration should be changed to `USER` at CERN if you plan to go on site. This should be done a maximum 6 months before your visit and at minimum it should be finalised 1 wek before your arrival. 

The registration is initiated by that either Ulrik or Tom fill in the [EDH document](https://edh.cern.ch/Document/Personnel/PreRegistrationForm) and pick `USER` as the status. In adition the [Home Institute Declaration](https://usersoffice.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/pdf/Formalities/HomeInstitutionDeclarationforUO.pdf) should be filled in and forwarded to Tom or Ulrik (who in turn gets it signed by the Head of School and attach it to the EDH form).
